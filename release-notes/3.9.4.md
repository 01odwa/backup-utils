## Bug Fixes

* On an instance with Actions enabled, incorrect backup and restore settings prevented the storage container name from being restored. This made the logs from that container inaccessible, and caused Actions to create a new storage container in a different location. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/backup-utils-private/pull/652, https://github.com/github/backup-utils-private/pull/459 {% endcomment %}

## Backups and Disaster Recovery

When a NFS mount is detected for snapshots on backup hosts, backup logs will show a warning to notify the user that such a setup may incur performance issues as highlighted in [storage requirements](https://github.com/github/backup-utils-private/blob/master/docs/requirements.md#storage-requirements) documentation.
